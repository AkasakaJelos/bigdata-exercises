    "## Exercise 3: Safe and Indempotent HTTP methods\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP methods are crucial in RESTful APIs and typically correspond to the main CRUD operations:\n",
    "  - **GET** is used to *retrieve* a resource (Read).\n",
    "  - **POST** is used to *create* a new resource (Create).\n",
    "  - **PUT** is used to *update* an existing resource (Update).\n",
    "  - **DELETE** is used to *remove* a resource (Delete).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safe Methods**: An HTTP method is considered *safe* if the action it performs is read-only and does not modify the resource on the server. Making a \"safe\" request should not cause any side effects on the server data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Idempotent Methods**: An HTTP method is *idempotent* if multiple **identical** requests in a row produce the same effect on the server as a single request would. In other words, sending the same request once or multiple times should give the same end result on the server state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the table below by indicating with **Yes** or **No** whether each method is **Idempotent** and/or **Safe**\n",
    "\n",
    "| HTTP Method | Idempotent? | Safe? |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **GET**     | Yes         | Yes   |\n",
    "| **POST**    | No          | No    |\n",
    "| **PUT**     | Yes         | No    |\n",
    "| **DELETE**  | Yes         | No    |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GET**  \n",
    "   - **Safe**: A `GET` request is intended only to *retrieve* a resource without making any changes to it. Therefore, it does not modify the server state.  \n",
    "   - **Idempotent**: Multiple `GET` requests to the same URL result in the same action (retrieving the resource) without changing its state. Hence, doing it once or several times yields the same effect on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **POST**  \n",
    "   - **Not Safe**: A `POST` request is often used to *create* a new resource by submitting data that changes the server state in some way (e.g., inserting a new record in a database).  \n",
    "   - **Not Idempotent**: If you send the same `POST` request multiple times, it would create multiple separate resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PUT**  \n",
    "   - **Idempotent**: A `PUT` request usually *replaces* or *updates* a resource at a given URI. Sending the same `PUT` request multiple times with the same payload leads to the same final state.  \n",
    "   - **Not Safe**: Even though it’s idempotent, a `PUT` modifies a resource, so it is not considered “safe” under HTTP definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DELETE**  \n",
    "   - **Idempotent**: A `DELETE` request, if repeated multiple times, will remove the same resource. Subsequent `DELETE` requests do not further change the server’s state.  \n",
    "   - **Not Safe**: Like `PUT`, it modifies the server’s state by removing a resource, so it is not a “read-only” operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further information and explanations you can visit [Idempotent HTTP Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent) and [Safe HTTP Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Safe/HTTP)\n"

    "#### Scenario:\n",
    "- **Target SLA**: 99.95% availability each 30-day billing cycle.\n",
    "- **Definition of Availability**: The service is considered \"available\" as long as end users can connect and use its core functionality. Any time the service is unreachable or non-functional is considered downtime.\n",

    "1. **Determine total minutes in 30 days**  \n",
    "   - 1 day = 24 hours  \n",
    "   - 1 hour = 60 minutes  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Sum the downtime**  \n",

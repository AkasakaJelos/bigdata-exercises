    "A Spark driver is responsible for converting a user program into units of physical execution called tasks. At a high level, all Spark programs follow the same structure: they create RDDs from some input, derive new RDDs from those using transformations, and perform actions to collect or save data. A Spark program implicitly creates a logical **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of operations.\n",
    "When the driver runs, it converts this logical graph into a physical execution plan.\n",

    "Spark performs several optimizations, such as \"pipelining\" map transformations together to merge them, and converts the execution graph into a set of **stages**.\n",

    "* User code defines a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of RDDs. Operations on RDDs create new RDDs that refer back to their parents, thereby creating a graph.\n",
    "* Actions force translation of the DAG to an execution plan. When you call an action on an RDD, it must be computed. This requires computing its parent RDDs as well. \n",
    "* Spark's scheduler submits a job to compute all needed RDDs. That job will have one or more stages, which are parallel waves of computation composed of tasks. Each stage will correspond to one or more RDDs in the DAG. A single stage can correspond to multiple RDDs due to pipelining.\n",

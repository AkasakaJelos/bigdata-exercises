    "Document stores are collections of *documents*. Documents can be of many formats: JSON, XML, YAML, or binary formats such as BSON, PDF, or Microsoft Office files. For instance, MongoDB documents are logically structured as JSON, but are stored and transmitted internally as BSON (Binary JSON).  Documents are composed of field-value pairs and have the following structure:\n",

You might find `$set` and `$avg` useful.\n",

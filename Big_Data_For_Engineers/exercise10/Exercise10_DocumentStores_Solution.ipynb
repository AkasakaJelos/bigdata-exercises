    "\n",
    "Document stores are collections of *documents*. Documents can be of many formats: JSON, XML, YAML, or binary formats such as BSON, PDF, or Microsoft Office files. For instance, MongoDB documents are logically structured as JSON, but are stored and transmitted internally as BSON (Binary JSON).  Documents are composed of field-value pairs and have the following structure:\n",

    "\n",
    "The values of fields may include other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents, making the documents arbitrarily nested. Data in MongoDB does not need to adhere to the same schema even within the same collection. All documents do not need to have the same set of fields or structure, and common fields in a collection's documents may hold different types of data."

    "1. Flexibility. Not every record needs to store the same properties. New properties can be added on the fly, therefore we can use document stores to hold and query heterogeneous data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Yes. References *can be* used for data normalization as shown in the example above. However, it is in general not suggested in document stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In document stores, denormalization means that all data related to an object is typically stored within a single document. This design improves performance for *read operations*, as it eliminates the need for expensive joins and allows related data to be retrieved in a single query. In addition, embedded data models make it possible to update related data in a single atomic write operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, denormalization can hurt *write performance*, as updates to duplicated data must be applied across multiple documents. It may also increase document size and storage overhead, particularly in write-heavy or frequently changing datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A large number of small documents can degrade performance due to higher overhead in indexing, memory usage, and disk I/O. Each document carries metadata and index entries, so storing millions of small documents increases storage and slows query execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the documents share a logical grouping and are often accessed together, consider embedding them into a single larger document, often called *roll-up*. This allows for more efficient sequential reads and smaller index sizes, since shared fields only appear once per group. See Section 4. *Indexes* for more information on indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, this trade-off depends on access patterns. If queries frequently target only individual items within a group, embedding may cause unnecessary I/O. Similarly, if the embedded data is frequently updated independently, maintaining smaller separate documents may be more efficient and semantically appropriate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store. The difference lies in the way the data is processed: in a key-value store, the data is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system relies on an internal structure of the documents in order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further optimization. Although the difference is often mostly in tools of the systems, conceptually the document-store is designed to offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques."

    "### Solution \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `db.restaurants.createIndex({\"borough\" : 1})`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. No, indexes on embedded documents support only equality matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `db.restaurants.createIndex({\"address.zipcode\" : 1})`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The following queries benefit from the index:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a) since `borough` is an index prefix of the compound index, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) equality match for compound index, \n",
    "    \n",
    "    d) since `borough` is an index prefix of the compound index, and\n",
    "    \n",
    "    f) as inverse indexes (multiplying each direction by -1) are equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The same answer, since `{ \"borough\": 1, \"cuisine\": -1, \"name\" : -1}` has prefix `{ \"borough\": 1, \"cuisine\": -1 }`.\n",
    "6. No, for a compound multikey index, each indexed document can have at most one indexed field whose value is an array. As such, you cannot create a compound multikey index if more than one to-be-indexed field of a document is an array. \n",
    "7. Just ```db.restaurants.createIndex( \"grades.grade\": 1)```, since ```{\"name\" : 1 , \"address.street\": 1}``` is a projection. Note that in general negation is inefficient. \"ne\" queries can use an index, but not very well. They must look at all the index entries other than the one specified by the \"ne\", so they basically have to scan the entire index. Therefore although the total number of objects that are scanned as well their size are reduced, the index is not fully efficient.\n",
    "8. `db.restaurants.createIndex({\"grades.score\": 1 , \"grades.grade\": 1 })`\n",
    "\n",
    "    However, for this particular query this index [is not used efficiently](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/sort-results-with-indexes/): `db.restaurants.find({\"grades.score\" : {$gt : 50} }).sort({\"grades.score\": 1})`\n",
    "9. b) covers more cases since MongoDB will use index intersection for queries on two fields. Thus, B includes A. However the compound index is faster than two single-field indexes when you querying for two fields. \n",
    "10. Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the indexed field, even if the index field contains a null value. The index skips over any document that is missing the indexed field. The index is \"sparse\" because it does not include all documents of a collection. By contrast, non-sparse indexes contain all documents in a collection, storing null values for those documents that do not contain the indexed field.\n",
